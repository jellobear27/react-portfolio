            ABOUT ME: My name is Janell Smith and I am currently a student
            taking a bootcamp course through Rutgers University. I started
            coding 9 months ago using a free online platform. I'm inspired to
            learn this new skill set as it will allow me to be a better asset to
            the companies I am currently a part of and I'm excited to see what
            new doors will open. I hope to build apps in the future that bring
            people together and help solve the pandemic of lonleyness.
