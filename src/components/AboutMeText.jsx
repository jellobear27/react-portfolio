Hello, I'm Janell Smith, a junior Full Stack Web Developer passionate about crafting immersive digital experiences. My journey into the world of web development began with a transformative 6-month bootcamp course at Rutgers University. Since then, I've been driven by a desire to continually evolve and innovate in this ever-evolving field.

My primary focus revolves around mastering React and exploring the fascinating realm of three.js. With an insatiable curiosity and dedication to learning, I'm determined to push the boundaries of what's possible in web development.

One of my core aspirations as a junior developer is to collaborate on group projects, leveraging the power of teamwork to create impactful solutions. Additionally, I'm constantly nurturing my creative ideas, endeavoring to bring them to life through my own solo development projects.

My passion for user interface and user experience design fuels my desire to build web applications that not only function seamlessly but also contribute positively to mental health. I firmly believe in the potential of technology to improve well-being, and I'm committed to creating applications that make a meaningful difference in people's lives.

I'm excited about the intersection of technology and mental health and am actively seeking opportunities to contribute my skills and creativity to this important space. Let's connect and create together, shaping a future where technology becomes a tool for enhancing mental wellness.
